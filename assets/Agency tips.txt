For form collection and leads (CRM)
Option 1: Using FormSubmit (Easiest, No Code Required)

🔗 Website: https://formsubmit.co

✅ Steps:

Replace the form’s action attribute with your own email address in FormSubmit format:

<form action="https://formsubmit.co/YOUR_EMAIL@example.com" method="POST">


Add hidden fields for better control:

<input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New Property Inquiry - Lateef Properties">
<input type="hidden" name="_template" value="table">
<input type="hidden" name="_captcha" value="false">
<input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://www.lateefbuilders.com/thankyou.html">


The first time someone submits a form, you’ll get a confirmation email — click “Confirm” to start receiving future submissions.

After confirmation, every form submission will email you directly with all the fields neatly formatted.

🧩 Example Form (FormSubmit version):
<form action="https://formsubmit.co/info@lateefbuilders.com" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New Property Inquiry - Lateef Properties">
  <input type="hidden" name="_template" value="table">
  <input type="hidden" name="_captcha" value="false">
  <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://www.lateefbuilders.com/thankyou.html">

  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Full Name" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email Address">
  <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone / WhatsApp" required>
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Tell us what you’re looking for..."></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Submit Inquiry</button>
</form>


💡 Tip: Create a small thankyou.html page that says “Thank you for contacting Lateef Properties — our team will reach out soon.”

⚙️ Option 2: Using EmailJS (More Flexible, For Dynamic Forms)

🔗 Website: https://www.emailjs.com

✅ Steps:

Create an EmailJS account and add a new email service (e.g., Gmail).

Create a new template for your email body.

Copy your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key.

Install EmailJS (no backend needed)
In your HTML, add this script in the <head> or before </body>:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js"></script>
<script>
  (function(){
    emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
  })();
</script>


Attach it to your form (JS):

<script>
document.querySelector(".lead-form").addEventListener("submit", function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  emailjs.sendForm("YOUR_SERVICE_ID", "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID", this)
    .then(() => {
      alert("Your inquiry has been sent successfully!");
      this.reset();
    }, (error) => {
      alert("Failed to send message, please try again.");
      console.error(error);
    });
});
</script>


You can fully customize the email template inside EmailJS (include branding, project name, etc.).

🧠 Recommendation:

If you want fast setup + reliability, use FormSubmit.
If you want dynamic behavior (like auto-including project name, or CRM integration), go with EmailJS.
